<h2>📖 Devlog</h2>
<p><strong>21.6. The front end takes shape—not with noise, but with patience. Rufus is watching. <br></p>
<p><strong>17.6. The grille is breathing now. Fog knows it too. <br></p>
<p><strong>16.6. GearBlood isn’t about crossing the line — it’s about finding one more left unplayed. <br></p>
<p><strong>13.6. Second attempt at a handmade procedural tree: four UDIMs, Mari-painted bark, no glitches this time. It finally stood still in Unreal — and felt like it belonged.🌲<br></p>
<p><strong>9.6. Today I learned that even a tree can open a dimensional rift if you feed it the wrong normal map. 🪐<br></p>
<p><strong>6.6. A feather fell into place. Geometry sings when logic dances.🧠<br></p>
<p><strong>4.6. Transformed thousands of delicate fiber curves into clean geometry without breaking a single strand — sometimes, magic wears a wireframe coat.🪶<br></p>
<p><strong>2.6. One feather, one step closer — Rufus gets his first plume today, and Mari’s just warming up.🪶✨<br></p>
<p><strong>1.6. Today, we’re carving socket joints into Rufus’s wings—where bone meets brass and instinct becomes interface.🛠️🪽✨<br></p>
<p><strong>30.5. Laid down the first structural lines of Rufus’s maxilla — the silent beginnings of a beak that might one day speak. 🪶<br></p>
<p><strong>29.5. Spent the whole day wrangling edge loops around a magpie’s skull – Rufus no longer looks modeled, he looks like he’s about to judge my topology choices. 🐦🧠<br></p>
<p><strong>26.5. Rufus refused to flatten himself into a map today. Quite the noble beak." 🐦🎩<br></p>
<p><strong>25.5. Six UDIMs, four gigabytes of feathers, and Rufus is finally ready to breathe in Mari. 🖤<br></p>
<p><strong>24.5. Today, Rufus got his wings.
Not figuratively. Physically. Digitally. Fully formed geometry.<br>

The morning began by sweeping through a web of polygons. As the day wore on, we sculpted talons, sealed beaks, and wrestled UV shells that refused to behave. One claw in particular put up a fight – maybe symbolic, maybe just a rogue edge loop that didn’t want to fall in line.<br>
But in the end, it did.<br>
<p>The model is now:
cleaned and topologically sound
fully UV unwrapped across six UDIMs, each one named like a knight on a quest
ready to enter Mari, where it will gain its identity – scratches, dirt, memory.</p>
<p>The work clocked in at over 7 hours. The sculpt ran with symmetry, yet somehow the soul of it didn’t. Rufus is becoming more than an asset – he's beginning to feel like a silent witness to a story, with eyes that are not yet open, but will soon learn to look backward.<br>
Biggest victory today?
The silence in my head when Blender's UV grid didn’t flash a single red "overlap" warning.</p><br>
🖋 Written between 3D cables, the click-click of Blender, and a quiet coffee break.<br>

<p><strong>22.5. A real maple leaf from my backyard is now part of GearBlood’s world. 🍁</strong></p>
<p><strong>21.5. A decision was made today—one not about frames, but about presence.
We chose silence in some places so a voice can be heard elsewhere.<br>

Less light. More weight.
Fewer reflections. More reflection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>20.5. Textured a wall today. It didn’t collapse, so I’m calling it progress.</strong></p>
<p><strong>19.5. Today’s pit stop:
We wrestled a bit with HTML and CSS — alignment, styles, and a few forgotten tags. Nothing a well-placed semicolon couldn’t fix.</strong></p>
<p><strong>18.5.2025 Went texture hunting right after the rain.
Wet boots, muddy roads, and at least three confused pigeons.
But hey — rust never sleeps, and neither do I.</strong> 🎯📸</p><br/>
<p><strong>17.5.2025 Today’s sound gathering was a joy. We’re bringing a piece of the real forest into GearBlood — with every rustle, chirp, and breath.</strong><br/><br/><br/>
<p><strong>15.5.2025 GearBlood is officially moving to Unreal Engine.</strong><br/>
<em>Mari paints with cinematic precision — <br/>
and Unreal listens without losing a single stroke.</em></p><br/><br/>
<p><strong>14.5.2025 marked the creation</strong> of our first fully hand-crafted <strong>4K seamless grass texture</strong>.<br/>
<em>From a single mobile photograph — through Krita and Blender — into a polished 4K render.</em></p>
